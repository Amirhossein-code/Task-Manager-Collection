### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Used

- Django
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- smtp4dev

## üî∫Development Experience

Working on the Task Manager API with Django and DRF was a rewarding journey, especially for those venturing into web development. Django, known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, offers a rich set of built-in features that make development smoother and more intuitive. The admin panel, in particular, simplifies data management and user administration, providing a great starting point for any project.

This project reinforced valuable concepts like serializers for data validation and viewsets for managing CRUD operations. Django‚Äôs ORM made database interactions straightforward, allowing us to focus more on building features rather than dealing with low-level queries.

While Django's structured approach is less flexible than some other frameworks, it provides a clear and organized foundation that facilitates efficient development and quick iterations. This structure can be very helpful, especially for those new to API development.

Overall, the Django (DRF) implementation turned out to be user-friendly and robust, making it an excellent choice for creating maintainable APIs that can adapt to various needs.

## üì¶ Getting Started
