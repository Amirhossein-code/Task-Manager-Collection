# Task Manager API Collection

## Description

This repository explores how to build a basic task management API using different frameworks. It focuses on implementing core features to provide a clear view of how these are handled across various technologies.

The implementations are designed to be simple and approachable, rather than exhaustive. The goal is to provide a minimal, functional API with JWT-based authentication and basic user and task management, allowing developers to understand the essentials of each framework without unnecessary complexity.

## Implementations

### 1. Django (DRF)

**[Django (DRF)](django-drf/README.md)**

The Django (DRF) implementation offers a straightforward approach to building web APIs with Django and the Django REST Framework. It utilizes Django’s built-in features, such as automatic authentication and the admin panel, to create a functional API with minimal setup. This implementation highlights how to leverage Django’s rich ecosystem to build a basic task management system efficiently.

### 2. FastAPI (Synchronous)

**[FastAPI](fastapi/README.md)**

The FastAPI implementation provides a modern, efficient way to build web APIs. It highlights FastAPI’s intuitive routing, dependency injection, and asynchronous capabilities. With SQLAlchemy for database management, this implementation demonstrates how to create a clear and performant API. It showcases FastAPI’s strengths in handling tasks and users while keeping the setup simple and focused on essential features.
